# Providing an Environment for Students to learn the Basics of Python and Computer Science

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/requirements/master)

Jupyter Notebooks is a great way to visualize the concepts of code. It is a very good fit to teach others the basics of coding by directly showing the results, instead of discussing theoretical behaviors. Binder provides a solution to create a Jupyter Notebook environment from scratch for students to play around.

## Introduction

The Exercise Notebooks are intended as a playground for people who are unfamiliar with coding. Solutions are provided for all exercises.
Writing your first program can be done in 3 easy steps.

### Step 1

Browse to a notebook in either the Exercises or Lessons folder

### Step 2

Open the notebook

### Step 3

Run your code by pressing 'Strg + Enter' in a cell.

## Warning

Before working on the exercise be warned that the changes are not saved in the cloud. This is part of the trade off to have clean, fresh environments in the browser every time you access the mybinder link.

## Saving your work

To save your work there are two possibilities. The first version is recommended for students who intend to only work in the Jupyter Notebooks themselves and do not need an IDE (e.g. Data Scientists). The second version is aimed at more sophisticated students (e.g. Programmers).

### Saving your work - Option 1

The first option to save your work is by downloading the files manually on your local machine. You can download the files by choosing the 'File' -> 'Download as' - 'Notebook (.ipynb)' option from the menu as shown below

### Saving your work - Option 2

The second option to save your work is to use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> and create a clone of this repository. I will leave it to the student as a learning exercise to acquire the knowledge to install and configure the necessary tools.

## Troubleshooting

Sometimes the mybinder homepage will not start nice immediately. In case the page does not load within 10-15 seconds, please hit 'F5' to refresh the page. If the issue persists please reach out to me.

## Acknowledgements

The lessons are intended to be a "Cheat Sheet" of the book "Think Python" from Allen Downey. For comperhensive explanation of the topics please check out his work. You can access the book on the website https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/

Additional notes and remarks are added by advice taken from discussions with my friends and colleagues and watching/reading <a href="http://www.cleancoder.com/products">Uncle Bob Martin</a>.

## Special Thanks

Special shout out goes to my friends <a href="https://github.com/tfelix">tfelix</a>, <a href="https://github.com/domiimob">domiimob</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Feliys">Feliys</a>, who are passionate coders with a big heart for all things programming. They took many hours out of their lives to help me getting started with progamming and gave me valuable feedback along the way. Without them I would not be where I am today.
