# Providing an Environment for Students to learn the Basics of Python and Computer Science

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/binder-examples/requirements/master)

Jupyter Notebooks is a great way to visualize the concepts of code. It is a very good fit to teach others the basics of coding by directly showing the results, instead of discussing theoretical behaviors. Binder provides a solution to create a Jupyter Notebook environment from scratch for students to play around.

The lessons are intended to be a "Cheat Sheet" of the book "Think Python" from Allen Downey. For comperhensive explanation of the topics please check out his work. You can access the book on the website https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/

Additional notes and remarks are added by advice taken from discussions with my friends and colleagues and watching/reading <a href="http://www.cleancoder.com/products">Uncle Bob Martin</a>.

Special shout out goes to my friends <a href="https://github.com/tfelix">tfelix</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Feliys">Feliys</a>, who are passionate coders with a big heart for all things programming. They took many hours out of their lives to help me getting started with progamming. Without them I would not be where I am today.
